## Hi there 👋

I'm an Engineering Manager / Software Developer at Google. In my spare time, I've been enjoying vibe-coding some hobby projects. I've made a few of them (the semi-useful and hopefully not completely embarrasing ones) available here on GitHub. Feel free to browse and try things; most are also already hosted somewhere so you can just try them out directly.
